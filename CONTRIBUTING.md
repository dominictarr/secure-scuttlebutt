## So you want to help with _secure-scuttlebutt_?

_secure-scuttlebutt_ is a do-ocracy. that means ruled by doers.
If you want to help, you need to figure out what you need to do and then do it.
There are no managers. The best way to do this is probably to discuss with other
contributors. for this use issues and irc (find us in #stackvm on irc)

Make a pull request, and once there is a consensus amongst the contributors a maintainer can merge.
(A maintainer is just a role - they just merge patches and apply semver and then release.
a maintainer does not have special powers, just special responsibilities. They do not cast a breaking vote,
they just observe when consensus has been achieved, merge and publish)

Anyone who makes a significant contribution will be added as a contributor to the project.
Do not `git push master`. never `git push --force`. make a pull request,
this also goes for the original project author once other people have been added to the project.
